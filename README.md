# About Daniel Hannih
I make and create lots of fun stuff. 

## Current projects

### PsyCat Games
PsyCat Games is an entertainment platform founded in 2018 that provides party games, quizzes, apps, and conversation starters. Today we are reaching millions of people each month from all around the world. Because having fun is not cultural. Itâ€™s human.

### swatches.gallery
swatches.gallery generates thousands of beautiful color gradients for designers and developers, with just a simple click. I created this tool because I am lazy of coming up with new gradients. ðŸ¤«
